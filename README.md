# AmrTheScientist
 👋 Hey there, I’m Amr!

A data whisperer with a laptop, turning chaos into clean, insightful stories (and sometimes into powerful machine learning models).

When I'm not translating datasets into decisions, I'm probably thinking about food... or pyramids... or both.


 🧠 What I Do

- 🔧 Fix messy data like a digital plumber
- 📊 Visualize trends that even your boss can understand
- 🔍 Predict churn before your customers even *think* about leaving
- 🤖 Build smart ML models that feel like mini oracles
- 🕷️ Crawl the web (ethically!) and bring back treasure (aka data)

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade

Python • Pandas • NumPy • Scikit-learn • Seaborn • Matplotlib • Web Scraping  
Jupyter Notebooks • GitHub • Deep Google Searches and Lo-fi Beats 🎧

## 🚀 My Favorite Creations

- 🧾 [Credit Card Churn Predictor]  
  Helped a fictional bank *almost* cry tears of joy with predictions and clean visuals.

- 📞 [Telecom Churn Classifier]  
  Trained a model to predict who's ghosting your service and why.

- 📊 [EDA on Credit Card Users]  
  Data had secrets. I made them talk with visuals, filters, and clean storytelling.

- 🛒 [E-commerce Web Scraper] 
  I taught a script to shop online without spending money. Impressive, right?
